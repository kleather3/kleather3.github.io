			<h2>Different Breeds of Guinea Pig</h2>
		</div>
	  <p> There are 13 different breeds of guinea pig, most of the special breeds are not kept as pets so you may never have heard of some of them&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;1)	<strong>Abyssinian Guinea Pig</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>These guinea pigs have permanent be head due to the cowlicks in their fur all over their bodies, they are also very excitable.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>2)	<strong>American Guinea Pig</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>This is the most common type of guinea pig and comes in nineteen different colours. They are very sweet and docile hence why they make such popular pets!<p/>
	  <p>3)	<strong>Peruvian Guinea Pig</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>These guys have insane hair it can grow up to two feet long making the Abyssinian’s bedhead look tidy! They are very alert and inquisitive animals.<p/>
	  <p>4)	<strong>Sheltie/Silkie Guinea Pig</strong>&nbsp; </p>
	  <p> Like the Peruvians these little critters have crazy hair but it’s a lot tidier as it only grows in one direction, backwards. They are very good pets for family with small children.</p>
      <p>5)	<strong>Sheba Guinea Pigs</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These little piggies are awesome they are very well known for their muttonchop facial hair that frames their face. This breed comes from Australia!</p>
      <p>6)	<strong>Coronet Guinea Pig</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This type also have long flowing hair like the Sheltie and are very demanding for attention from their owners. </p>
      <p>7)	<strong>Lunkarya</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This breed comes from Sweden and has a long curly coat that makes it look like a mop not a Guinea Pig! They are also affectionately known as Lunks!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>8)	<strong>Rex Guinea Pig</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These guys have very short fluffy hair unlike the other breed and love cuddles and being handled.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>9)	<strong>Baldwin Guinea Pig</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Baldwin’s are born with facial hair but no other hair on their bodies. They shed the facial hair until only a few whiskers remain. This makes them look like tiny hippos. They love the warmth but need an experienced owner.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>10)	<strong>Alpaca Guinea Pigs</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These little piggies have very thick and rough hair that is easily tangled. They require daily brushing!!!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>11)	<strong>Texel Guinea Pigs</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These guys have super dense wavy fur that also needs daily maintenance. They can be a bit beastly so are less commonly bred as pets.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12)	<strong>Teddy Guinea Pigs</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It’s in the name! These guys look like really fluffy teddies and are loving and playful. They make great pets and love spending time with other guinea pigs.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>13)	<strong>Skinny Guinea Pigs</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These little piggies are very similar to the Baldwin Guinea Pig and its because of all that hairless skin that they need a lot of maintenance. They are prone to skin infections and cuts and need an experienced owner. </p>
